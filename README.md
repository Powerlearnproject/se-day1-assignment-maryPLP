# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the use of structured methods to design, develop, and maintain software.
Why it matters:
Builds reliable and efficient software
Saves time and cost
Helps manage complex projects

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1960s: Software engineering term introduced to solve the "software crisis."
1970s: Waterfall model and structured programming became popular.
2000s: Agile and DevOps improved flexibility and faster delivery.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Understand what’s needed.
Planning: Create a roadmap.
Design: Plan the software structure.
Coding: Build the software.
Testing: Find and fix bugs.
Deployment: Release the software.
Maintenance: Improve after release.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall	is Step-by-step process while agile is	Flexible and iterative
waterfall Changes are hard while agile Changes are easy
waterfall Best for well-defined projects while agile Best for changing requirements

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writes code.
QA Engineer: Tests software for bugs.
Project Manager: Keeps the project on track.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs (e.g., VS Code): Make coding easier with built-in tools.
VCS (e.g., Git): Tracks code changes and helps team collaboration.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Complex code: Break into smaller parts.
Missed deadlines: Plan better with Agile.
Bugs: Test thoroughly.
Security issues: Follow safe coding practices.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit: Test small parts of code.
Integration: Check if modules work together.
System: Test the whole application.
Acceptance: Make sure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Crafting clear instructions to get better AI responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: "Tell me about programming."
Improved: "Explain Python’s OOP principles with examples."
Why the improved one is better:

Clear, specific, and focused.
Provides a direct answer to the user’s need.
